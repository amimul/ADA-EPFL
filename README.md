# Title
Cooking With Data

# Abstract
Cooking and Eating healthy should not be complicated. In order to make this simple, we would like to explore, map and visualize flavors and ingredients that are dominant in certain dishes and cuisines, which and how ingredients are clustered around these and what information of nutrition benefit can be achieved from this. We would also like to make visualization map of flavors explorable and searchable in order to inspire and educate anyone with interest in looking behind particular recipes. 

 We intend to use different visualization approaches in order to investigate whether interaction does play a significant role in communicating the underlying patterns within the chosen sample data set.

If possible we would like to further enrich the given data set with additional data scraped from the recipe websites. Databases with nutritional information on the ingredients could be used to fill in the nutritional information missing from the recipes.



# Research questions
The  research question that we would like to answer at first is the following: 

"Are there subsets of ingredients that are regularly used together and subsets that are never combined with each other and what is a good way to visualize this?". 

Using this information we could answer other research questions. 


"Are certain ingredients associated more than others and therefore form a basis must have of ingredients at home?   


"Is it possible to, based on the subsets, generate new recipes or propose ingredients that go well with the ingredients that you have at home? "

"Can we propose enhancements to certain recipes?" . 

<strike>"Based on the ratings of the recipes,is it possible to find certain combinations that are loved more than others?" </strike>

Since we got feedback that we had too much research questions we decided to drop the last research question and really focus on our algorithms on the ingredients.


# Dataset
The dataset that will be used is the one on recipes provided by infolab stanford. This dataset consists of 2.5GB of html files, a readme and 1 $.tsv$ file with tab-seperated columns containing information about: The domain,url,recipe title,kcal,ingredients,.. but a bunch of data is missing. This data is quite limited in the information it provides therefore additional processing of the html files is necesairry to draw more interesting conclusions. In retrospect the ingredient data is sufficient to draw interesting conclusions (see exploretara data analysis). However we do need extra information from an external database. Why and how is described in the notebook on M2.
# The notbook on M2 contains
- How we clean the data
- An explotary analysis in which we associate ingredients
- Methods that we will use to predict ingredients.
- Further planning of the project

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 3
-	See notebook on M2.
